# Network-Topology-Matrices

Formalization of Network Topology Matrices

This repository contains a library for the network topology matrices using Isabelle/HOL theorem prover.

It can be used for analyzing network systems represented by directed graphs using network topology matrices, including the incidence, loop and cutset matrices.
